// ff_inhib.g: a simple model of layer 1 horizontal cells
//     ("feedforward inhibitory" interneurons) in piriform cortex.
//     There are actually two types of these cells; one is located
//     more superficially and receives only afferent (feedforward)
//     input, while the other is located deeper in the cortex and
//     receives afferent and associational (feedback) input.
